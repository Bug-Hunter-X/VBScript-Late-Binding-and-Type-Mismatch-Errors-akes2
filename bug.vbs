Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript uses late binding, meaning variable types aren't checked until runtime. This can lead to unexpected errors if you try to perform operations on variables that have incompatible types. For example, attempting to add a string to a number without explicit type conversion can cause a runtime error.

Example:
dateVar = "2024-03-10"
numberVar = 10
result = dateVar + numberVar  'This will cause a type mismatch error.
